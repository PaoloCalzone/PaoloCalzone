- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaoloCalzone
- 👀 I’m interested in hacking real life situations, especially those where a centralized power is an obstacle for more freedom and social justice. And I try to do it
with all the concepts and the tools Ethereum's blockchain created.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing dApps bringing together my past experience in fullstack applications and my actual work on smart contracts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project in that field...
